Execute 

./1_download.sh

./2_setup.sh

./3_build.sh


Use:

dd if=BUILD/YoctoCamera/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi/<rpi-sdimg> of=/dev/<sdcard> bs=1M

mount the first partition and copy the folder
BUILD/YoctoCamera/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi/extlinux
onto the sdcard.


The board has network configure and should come up with a wifi hotspot named "YoctoCamera".

If that does not work out of the box, connect the serial2usb-cable and inspect the
terminal.

A service starts mjpgstreamer on port 8080.

Have fun !
