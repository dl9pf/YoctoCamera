./2_setup.sh

./3_build.sh


Use:

dd if=BUILD/YoctoCamera/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi/<rpi-sdimg> of=/dev/<sdcard> bs=1M

Mount the first partition and copy the folder
BUILD/YoctoCamera/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi/extlinux
onto the sdcard.

Unmount the first partition.


The board has network configure and should come up with a wifi hotspot named "YoctoCamera".

IP is 192.168.1.2 or 192.168.1.3 .

If that does not work out of the box, connect the serial2usb-cable and inspect the
terminal.

(Mount the 2nd partition and adapt the network settings in etc/network/interfaces.)

A service starts mjpgstreamer on port 8080.

Have fun !
